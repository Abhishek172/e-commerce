## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

![reactjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)&nbsp;

- Used for its easy creation of dynamic applications, it's performance edge like virtual DOM, reuseable components and unidirectional data flow.

![react-router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=for-the-badge&logo=react-router&logoColor=white)&nbsp;

- Enabled the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

![Ant-Design](https://img.shields.io/badge/-AntDesign-%230170FE?style=for-the-badge&logo=ant-design&logoColor=white) &nbsp;

- An enterprise-class UI design language and React UI library with a set of high-quality React components, one of best React UI library for enterprises.

**Backend:**

![nodejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)&nbsp;

- The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

![expressjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=white)&nbsp;

- A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.

![mongodb](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)&nbsp;

- Used because of its flexible schema makes it easy to evolve and store data in a way that is easy to work with. MongoDB is also built to scale up quickly and supports all the main features of modern databases such as transactions.

## Getting Started

#### _**IMPORTANT NOTE**_ -

This project does not have a mongoDB connection setup. Setup the connection based on the environments below.

- Local Development: Create a dev file (make sure to name it dev.js) in the config folder, which exports your db.uri connection.
- Production: Since the config file is not pushed when you deploy your app, you must specifiy your db uri in heorku. Set the uri in heroku as specified in [this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) resource. Make sure you name the environement variable "DB_URI".

### Clone

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/Abhishek172/movie-app.git

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ^10.0.0
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

You need client and server runs concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them talk to each other

Once in Project folder

### Client-side usage(PORT: 3000)

```terminal
$ cd client
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

### Server-side usage

```terminal
$ npm i
$ cd server
$ nodemon index.js
```
